#Answer the following questions (a) to (d).by explaining some frequently occurring errors. 

#a.     To help you answer the questions, write the code in python and run it to produce output for each of the questions.  

#b.     If you are trying to print your name, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks or both and why?   

#c.      What is the difference between * and ** operators in Python? Explain with the help of an example.  

#d.     In Python, is it possible to display an integer like 09? Justify your answer.
